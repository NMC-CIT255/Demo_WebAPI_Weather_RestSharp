Description:    This application uses the Web API from OpenWeatherMap to
                access current weather conditions using latitude and longitude or zip code.
		The two projects demonstrate the difference of synchronous vs asynchronous 
		methods using the RestSharp package.
		
		Note: Async not functioning currently.
